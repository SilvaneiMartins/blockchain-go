    Função Proof of Work

        // Take the data from the Block
        // Create a counter (nonce) which starts at 0
        // Create a hash of the data plus the counter
        // Check the hash to see if it meets a set of requirements
        // Requirements:
        // The First few bytes must contain 0s
